  Bindings for the TI DRV8328 gate driver.

include: base.yaml

compatible: "ti,drv8328"

properties:
  sleep-gpios:
    description: |
        GPIO pin used to put the DRV8328B into sleep mode.
    type: phandle-array

  fault-gpios:
    description: |
        GPIO pin used to indicate a fault condition. Should be configured 
        as an interrupt input to detect fault events immediately.
    type: phandle-array

  drvoff-gpios:
    description: |
        GPIO pin used to turn off the gate drivers on the DRV8328C and DRV8328D.
    type: phandle-array

  inlx-gpios:
    description: |
        GPIO pins connected to INLx inputs for forcing them high when 
        controlling via INHx PWM signals. Optional for advanced control schemes.
    type: phandle-array

  pwms:
    description: |
        PWM signal used to control INHx inputs for motor control.
        This property is required for the DRV8328B to function correctly.
