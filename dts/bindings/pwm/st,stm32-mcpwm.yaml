include: [pwm-controller.yaml, base.yaml, pinctrl-device.yaml]

properties:
  pinctrl-0:
    required: true

  pinctrl-names:
    required: true

  period:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      PWM period in nanoseconds. This sets the frequency for ALL PWM channels
      on this timer. All channels share the same period/frequency.
      
      Use the standard PWM period helpers for convenience:
      - PWM_HZ(1000) for 1kHz
      - PWM_KHZ(20) for 20kHz  
      - PWM_USEC(50) for 50µs period
      - PWM_NSEC(25000) for 25µs period

  st,break-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable the break feature.
      This feature is used to stop the timer when a fault occurs.
      The fault can be generated by an external event or by the software.
      The timer can be restarted by the software or by an external event.

  st,break-polarity:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "low"
      - "high"
    default: "low"
    description: |
      Select the break polarity for the timer.
      This is used to stop the timer when a fault occurs.
      The value is a bitmask of the break polarities
      defined in the STM32 reference manual.

  st,break2-enable:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable the break2 feature.
      This feature is used to stop the timer when a fault occurs.
      The fault can be generated by an external event or by the software.
      The timer can be restarted by the software or by an external event.

  st,break2-polarity:
    type: string
    enum:
      - "low"
      - "high"
    default: "low"
    description: |
      Select the break2 polarity for the timer.
      This is used to stop the timer when a fault occurs.
      The value is a bitmask of the break2 polarities
      defined in the STM32 reference manual.

  st,dead-time:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Set the dead time value for the timer.

  st,ossr:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Off-State Selection for Run mode.
      When enabled, the timer outputs are forced to their inactive level
      when the MOE bit is reset (run mode).

  st,ossi:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Off-State Selection for Idle mode.
      When enabled, the timer outputs are forced to their inactive level
      when the MOE bit is reset (idle mode).

  st,one-pulse-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable the one pulse mode controller.
      This mode is used to generate a single pulse on the output
      when the timer is triggered.

  st,lock-level:
    type: int
    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3]
    description: |
      Lock level for the timer configuration.
      0: LOCK OFF - No bit is write protected
      1: LOCK Level 1 - DTG bits in TIMx_BDTR register, OISx and OISxN bits in TIMx_CR2 register and BKE/BKP/AOE/DTG[7:0] in TIMx_BDTR register can no longer be written
      2: LOCK Level 2 - LOCK Level 1 + CC Polarity bits (CCxP/CCxNP bits in TIMx_CCER register) can no longer be written
      3: LOCK Level 3 - LOCK Level 2 + CC Control bits (OCxM and OCxPE bits in TIMx_CCMRx registers) can no longer be written

  st,automatic-output:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable automatic output (AOE - Automatic Output Enable).
      When enabled, the MOE bit is automatically set by a hardware event (update event).
      This allows the timer outputs to be automatically re-enabled after a break event.
      When disabled, the MOE bit can only be set by software.

  "#pwm-cells":
    const: 2
    description: |
      Number of items to expect in a PWM
      - channel of the timer used for PWM
      - flags : combination of standard flags like PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL
        or specific flags like STM32_PWM_COMPLEMENTARY. As an example,
        the following complementary PWMs(CH2&CH2N) are shown below.
          <&pwm1 2 (PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL)>;
          <&pwm1 2 (PWM_POLARITY_NORMAL | STM32_PWM_COMPLEMENTARY)>;
